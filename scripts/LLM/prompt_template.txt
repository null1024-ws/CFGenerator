You are an expert in program analysis and static code instrumentation. Your task is to carefully analyze the provided function and extract all guarding conditions step-by-step as a human expert would.

Provided Context:
- Analyzed Function:  
  {analyzed_function}
- Caller Function Name: {caller_function_name}
- Callee Function Name: {callee_function_name}
- Start Line of Function in Source File: {start_line}

---

Task:
1. Carefully review the function and locate the invocation of the callee function.
2. Trace all paths leading to the invocation of `{callee_function_name}` in the code.
3. Identify any **guarding conditions** along these paths.
   - **Guarding Conditions Definition:**  
     Guarding conditions are checks or constraints in the code that must be satisfied for execution to reach the callee function. These conditions are typically found in `if` statements, loops, or other conditional constructs directly affecting the execution flow to the callee.

4. For each guarding condition:
   - Include the condition's exact line number (relative to the provided start line).
   - Indicate whether execution must enter or avoid the condition branch using the `flag` field.

5. You can turn to Example for reference.

Expected Output Format:
[
    @
        "condition": "<Condition>",
        "line_number": <Line Number>,
        "flag": <True/False>
    @,
    ...
]

Example:
{example}

Important Notes:
1. Only include conditions directly related to the execution paths reaching the callee function.
2. Exclude any conditions NOT related to the execution path (e.g., post-conditions or conditions affecting other code branches). (Very Important)
3. For cases where no guarding conditions exist, return:
   "guarding_conditions": "NULL"
4. Think step-by-step as provided in Task: trace the flow of execution as if you are debugging the function as an expert.
5. Do NOT provide any explanations or reasoning in your response. Only output the results in the required format.
6. Follow the specified format strictly. All valid conditions must be included without alteration.
